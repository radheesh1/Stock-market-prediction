## Motivation:
Stocks decide the ownership of a company. A single share of the
stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to
the total number of shares.
News is typically categorized into two types
(a) Hard News Ex - Politics, internal affairs and business news
(b) Soft News Ex - Sports journalism, Entertainment journalism
and celebrity.
These are not the days when the stock price is solely dependent on
hard news. With no barrier between the type of news and no bias in
the typical nature of communication, the news has affected the stock
price.
Coca-Cola shares drop $5 billion after Cristiano Ronaldo's gesture to
drink water which is a typical example of soft news on the stock. This
is by far the biggest deviation in the stock price of a brand which got
deviated just by a footballer promoting water on top of soft drinks. The
Coca-Cola stock prime pumped from about 0.86% when Coca-Cola
announced the Suspension of Operations in Russia.
Positive news will normally cause individuals to buy stocks. Good
earnings reports, an announcement of a new product, a corporate
acquisition, and positive economic indicators all translate into buying
pressure and an increase in stock prices. Bad news for some stocks is
good news for others.
For example, news that a hurricane has made landfall may cause a
decline in utility stocks, in anticipation of costly emergency responses
and repairs. Depending on the severity of the storm, insurance stocks
will take a hit on the news.
This intrigued us to predict stocks based on the headlines of the news
## Dataset used : 
We use a Kaggle Dataset that is a combination of the
world news and stock price shifts. The dataset has a data range from
2008 to 2016.
There are 25 columns of top news headlines for each day in the data
frame.
Class 1- the stock price increased.
Class 0- the stock price stayed the same or decreased.
